'Well, Mr Smith, if you prefer a different type of nose, we have a large selection available.'

'I think this nose is a bit too small.'

'Small noses are very fashionable this year, Mr Smith, very fashionable.'

'Do you think it suits me?' asked Mr Smith.

'I think it looks very nice,' said the shop assistant.

'OK, I'll take it!'

On the airbus home, Mr Smith called his wife on his wristphone.

'Hello dear! Do you like my new nose?'

Mrs Smith looked at her husband's new nose on the videophone monitor on the wall in the kitchen. 'I think it's a bit too small, dear,' she said.

'Small noses are very fashionable this year,' replied Mr Smith, 'very fashionable.' It's all so easy now, thought Mr Smith. A hundred years ago, it was impossible to change your body. Or almost impossible – there was the old-fashioned 'plastic surgery', but it was expensive, painful and dangerous. Ugh! Now, thanks to our 22nd-century genetic engineering, we can change our bodies when we want!

He looked at his new small nose in the mirror and thought about how fashionable he was. He was very happy with his new nose. The only problem now, he thought, was that he needed some new hair to go with his new nose.

He looked on the internet for some new hair, but the internet was so slow. Eventually he decided to go to Bodyco in person.

'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the Bodyco shop assistant. 'How can I help you today?'

Mr Smith remembered the robot shop assistant in the Bodyco shop a few years ago. The robot was friendlier and more efficient, but too many robots made too much unemployment and the robot was replaced by a human.

'I'd like some new hair, please.'

'Certainly, Mr Smith. What type of hair would you like? Short, blond hair goes well with a small nose. How about short, blond hair?'

Mr Smith looked at his hair. It was old and grey. Yes, he thought, short and blond. When he was young he had short, blond hair. He wanted to look young again.

'Yes, I'll have short blond hair, please. Could it be a bit curly as well?'

'Curly?' asked the shop assistant.

'Yes, you know, curly – not straight!'

'Yes, Mr Smith, I know what "curly" means, but curly hair isn't very fashionable this year.'

'Isn't it?'

'No, it isn't.'

'But I like curly hair!'

'Very well, Mr Smith – short, blond, curly hair. Would you like anything else? We have a special offer on ears this week.'

'Ears?'

'Yes, Mr Smith. The things you hear with.'

'I know what ears are! What type of ears are on offer?'

Mr Smith went out of the shop with new short, blond, curly hair and two new ears.

After this, his interest in his new body started to grow. In the next few weeks he bought new eyes (green – unusual, but fashionable), new hands, new arms, new knees and new feet. Mrs Smith was happy because Mr Smith's new feet didn't smell as bad as his old feet.

His body was now completely different.

'Am I the same man I was a few weeks ago?' thought Mr Smith. 'I have a new nose, new hair, new ears, new eyes, hands, arms, knees and feet. But I have the same brain – so I think I'm the same man.' He thought he was the same man but he wasn’t sure.

One morning, he woke up and his new nose didn't work.

'What’s the matter?' asked Mrs Smith.

'My new nose doesn't work – it's blocked.'

'Maybe you've got a cold,' suggested Mrs Smith.

'That’s impossible! This is a genetically engineered Bodyco nose! It doesn't get colds!'

But it was true – the new nose did not work. It was blocked and Mr Smith couldn't smell anything.

He went back to the Bodyco shop.

'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the assistant. 'What would you like today?'

'I want a new nose,' said Mr Smith.

'You already want a new nose?' said the surprised shop assistant. 'But you’ve only had this one for a month! Don't worry, small noses are still fashionable!'

'No, you don't understand,' said Mr Smith. 'I want a new nose because this one doesn't work!'

'That's impossible,' said the shop assistant. 'You have a genetically engineered Bodyco nose. It can't go wrong!'

'But it has gone wrong,' replied Mr Smith. 'It's blocked and I can't smell anything.'

'What have you used your nose to do, Mr Smith?' asked the shop assistant.

'What have I done with my nose? That's a stupid question! I haven't done anything unusual with my nose. I've used it to breathe and to smell, as usual!'

'If you have not used your nose correctly, Mr Smith, it is possible that it will not work correctly.'

'That's absurd!' shouted Mr Smith. 'I want my money back! I want a refund!'

'I'm afraid that we do not give refunds, Mr Smith. There was no guarantee with this nose.'

Mr Smith was so angry that he didn't know what to say. He walked out of the shop and didn't say anything.

But now he had a big problem: a useless nose. Fashionable, yes. Useful, no.

Unfortunately, his problems started to grow. The next morning he woke up and found he couldn't hear anything. Then his new blond hair went grey. Then his new knees didn't move. Then he couldn't see a thing with his unusual green eyes. His fingers fell off, one by one.
Eventually, Mrs Smith put him in their aircar and flew to the Bodyco shop. She carried her husband into the shop, because now he couldn't walk.

'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the shop assistant. 'What can I do for you today?'

'Mr Smith wouldn’t like anything new at all today, thank you,' replied Mrs Smith. 'But he would like his old body back!'

'I'm afraid we don't give refunds, Mrs Smith.'

'I don't want a refund,' explained Mrs Smith. 'I want my husband's original body again! I liked it more than this new one!'

'I'm afraid that's very difficult, Mrs Smith,' said the shop assistant. 'We are an environmentally friendly company. All our old bodies are recycled.'

'But the new body parts that you sold him don't work! What can he do now?'

'He could buy a reconditioned body.'

'What's a "reconditioned" body?'

'It's an old body that has been modified.'

'Can I have a look at one?'

'Certainly.' The shop assistant spoke to his computer and a reconditioned body appeared. It was a very familiar body. Mrs Smith recognised the big nose and the grey hair.

'But that's my husband!' shouted Mrs Smith. 'That's the original Mr Smith!'

'Yes, that's right,' said the shop assistant. 'We reconditioned Mr Smith's old body.'

'Can he have his old body back then, please?'

'Certainly, Mrs Smith. That'll be 100,000 euros, please.'

'100,000 euros!' shouted Mrs Smith. 'That's very expensive, isn't it?'

'Mr Smith has been reconditioned!'

Mr Smith got his own body back, and Mrs Smith flew him back home in the aircar.

'I'm myself again!' he shouted.

'Not exactly,' said Mrs Smith. 'You have been reconditioned.'

'What does "reconditioned" mean?'

'Well,' said Mrs Smith, 'I think it means that you have a new brain!'

'I think that will be very useful,' said Mr Smith.

'I think so too, dear,' said Mrs Smith.

Here's Scarlett, in the garden of a friend's house in London on a sunny summer morning, the kind of mornings that are unusual in England. Scarlett is twelve years old ('Thirteen in November,' she tells me), and is trying to understand the world around her. She asks questions about everything, all the time.

I tell her that I want to ask her a question, and I ask her why she's called Scarlett, and what the name means, and if it comes from anywhere in particular, and she says: 'No, it's just a stupid name my parents chose because they liked it. It doesn't mean anything.'

I wonder if her parents named her after the heroine of a favourite film, perhaps, but then again, I know her dad and this sounds unlikely. I think they probably chose it just because they liked the sound of it.

Scarlett is worried about changing school after the summer. She worries that she's too short for her age and that the other children at the school will make fun of her. She shows me some pictures of the school she is at now and her classmates. I look at the picture and it shows children of all heights and shapes and sizes. Some are tall, some are short, some are fat and some are thin. Some are black and some are white, and most of them are somewhere in between. Some have red hair and some have blond hair, some have long hair and some have short hair.

I tell her not to worry about the new school, tell her that she'll be OK, and ask her about the new subjects she'll be studying. She tells me that she's worried about learning French, and I tell her not to worry, that it isn't a very difficult language. She tells me that she already knows five languages.

'Five languages!' I shout. 'That's impossible! How do you already know five languages?'

'Because I've got five languages in my body,' she says.

I ask her what she means, and she starts to tell me the story of her family. Some of the story I already know. I've already heard stories about her grandfather. He was from Scotland; he was a sailor, but not a very good sailor, so he only got as far as Portsmouth, a big navy town on the south coast of England, not very far from Scotland at all. When he got to Portsmouth, he stopped there, left the navy and became a boxer. He lost fights and drank a lot. However, he still managed to see the world by meeting a woman who came from Laos. Nobody really knows how this woman had ended up in Portsmouth, but she still lives there, and I tell Scarlett that she should try and find out her grandmother's story.

'No, she's too old now,' says Scarlett, 'and anyway, she's lived in Portsmouth nearly all her life.'

Scarlett's grandparents were only together long enough to produce a son – probably one of the only Scottish-Laotians in the world. They called him Bill, which is usually short for 'William', but his name was just 'Bill'. Bill inherited his father's personality and his mother's looks, so the only thing he thought he could do was become a rock star. He never really managed to become a rock star, though, so now he works as a graphic designer.

I don't know Scarlett's mum, so I ask her to tell me about her mum.

'My mum's Polish,' she says. 'Well, not really, because she was born in Brighton, but her mum and dad are from Poland. But they've lived there, like, for always. But I know that her mum was from somewhere that was Germany and then became Poland, so she's really German, I suppose. So that's another language that I've got in my body.'

I ask Scarlett if she can actually speak all the languages that she says she has 'in her body', and she looks at me like I'm stupid.

'Of course not!' she says. 'But I've still got them in me!'

We count up her 'languages': Scottish, Laotian, German, Polish.

'That's only four!' I tell her.

'No, there's English too!'

'Of course there is,' I say. And then I look at Scottish–Laotian–German–Polish–English Scarlett, with her name that comes from nowhere, and I ask her: 'And you, Scarlett, where are you from?'

She thinks for a long time – such a long time that I think perhaps she hasn't heard my question. But then, before I can repeat it, she looks up and at me.

'I'm from here,' she says. 'I'm from London.'
